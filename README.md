# RSS Reader

Cross-platform RSS reader for local device use.  Front-end uses React/Redux, back-end uses Node.js/Express.  Deployment using Electron.

Nearing MVP completion, needs some refactoring and work integrating with Electron for deployments.  Currently allows feeds to be added, removed, and edited.  Feeds are displayed in lists with sub-lists for their specific articles.  Feeds can be filtered using links determined by categories specified by the user.
